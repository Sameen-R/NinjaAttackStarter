# NinjaAttackStarter
This is my first iOS app!<br/> 
I made a ninja game based on this tutorial, and added new features: https://www.raywenderlich.com/71-spritekit-tutorial-for-beginners#toc-anchor-002<br/>
To play, tap on the screen to throw ninja stars at monsters (and kill them).<br/>
Added Features:<br/>
-Mega-monsters that can be killed after being shot 6 times<br/>
-More mega-monsters spawning as the game progresses<br/>
-Dragons that give the player extra points<br/>
-Score tracker & a main screen with a button that resets the score<br/>

Future Features:<br/>
-A pop-up the warns the user before reseting the score<br/>
-Power-ups<br/>
-Another screen with the instructions<br/>
-Different game modes<br/>
-A shop
